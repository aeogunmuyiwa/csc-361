## Q1

  1. How long does it take a packet of length $L$=1000 bytes to propagate over a link of distance d=2500 km, where propagation speed is $s=2.5 \times 10^8$ m/s, and  transmission rate of $R$=2 Mbps?  

Propagation delay =d/s
2500000/2.5*1000000000 =0.01s 
10ms
Transmission delay= L/r
1000000/2000000=0.5
500
500+10=10.5ms
it take the packet 510ms

  2. More generally, how long does it take a packet of length $L$ to propagate over a link of distance $d$ with propagation speed $s$, and transmission rate $R$ bps?

Generally the overal  end to end daley is affected by three factors. First the propagation delay and the transmission delay and then the third factor is the Queueing delay. The queueing delay is due to packet buffers in routers. That means if the packet gets to a router and there is congestion with other pakcets, then the router will transmit the packets in a first in first out manner. that means our packet has to wait for its turn as a result there is a delay which is the queueing delay. So our packet will take time thats equal to the sum of  the propagation delay, transmission delay and the the sum of the queueing delay.




  3. Does this delay depend on **packet length**?

the overal delay is affected by the packet length and this directly affects the transmission delay the biggeer the length the bigger the delay.
the Queueing delay if not affected by the packet length.



  4. Does this delay depend on **transmission rate**?
  the transmission rate affect the  transmission delay therefore affect the overal end to end delay. the bigger the rate the smaller the delay becomes
the queueing delay how ever is not affected by these factors





## Q2
Suppose two hosts __A__ and __B__, are separated by $d$=20,000 km and are connected by a link $R$=1Gbps ($10^9$ bps). Assume that the propagation speed $s=2.5 \times 10^8$ m/s,

  1. Calculate the **bandwidth-delay** product, i.e., $R \times$ propagation delay. What is the **unit**?

Propagation delay =d/s =8ms
1Gbps*0.08=0.08Gb   =80 000 000 b
unit bits



  2. Consider sending a file of $L$=800,000 bits from __A__ to __B__. If the file is sent continuously as one large message, what is the **maximum** number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?
  
800,000 bits







  3. What is the **width (in meters) of a bit** in the link? (If $N$ is the number of bits in the wire with a distance of $K$ meters, then $K/N$ is meters per bit.)





  4. Derive a general expression for the **width of a bit** in terms of the propagation speed $s$, the transmission rate $R$ and the length of the link $d$.

## Q3
In modern packet-switched networks, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this process as __message segmentation__.


![](q3.jpg)


Assume we have a source __A__ and a destination __B__, connected via three links and two switches __S1__ and __S2__. __A__ connects to __S1__, __S1__ to __S2__, and __S2__ to __B__.


We will consider two case where a message is sent from __A__ to __B__ with and without __message segmentation__. Consider a message that is $L=7.5 \times 10^6$ bits long that is to be sent from __A__ to __B__ in the following manner. And suppose each link $R=1.5 \times 10^6$ bps. For the time being, ignore propagation, queuing, and processing delays.


  1. Consider sending the message from __A__ to __B__ without __message segmentation__. How long does it take to move the message from the host __A__ to the first packet switch __S1__? Keeping in mind that each switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the message from __A__ to __B__ ?
  Time to send to packet switch1 is 7.5 ∗ 10**6**/1.5 ∗ 10**6** = 5 s.
total delay for three hops is 5 s × 3 hops = 15 s.





  2. Now suppose that the message is __segmented__ into 5,000 packets, with each packet being 1,500 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from __A__ to the first switch __S1__?
  
 L/r then 1500/1.5 ∗ 106 = 1 ms for first packet to get to packet switch1






  3. When the first packet is being sent from the first switch __S1__ to the second switch __S2__, the second packet is being sent from the __A__ to the first switch __S1__. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch __S1__?
  
  It takes 2×1 ms = 2 ms for the first packet to get to switch 2
and this is the same time for the  second packet to get to the first switch






  4. How long does it take to move the file from __A__ to __B__ when __message segmentation__ is used?
  
first packet take 3ms to reach the destination

total time = 3ms+ (4999×1ms)=5.002s
